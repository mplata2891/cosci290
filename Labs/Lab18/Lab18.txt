Lab Description:  GROUP 3 & 4

                  Part 1
                  Add the feature of user input validation to your text
                  adventures. If a user enters an incorrect response to a
                  question, give feedback on what the user needs to do to give
                  correct input and then prompt the user to try again.

                  Part 2
                  Watch my demo on recursion.
                  Go to codingbat --> recursion-1 --> do problems: fibonacci,
                  bunnyEars2, and triangle

/*
  The Part 1 of this lab is continued and completed in the Lab 13 folder.
  A method for validating input will be found in the Utility.java file.

  Part 2 will be completed in CodingBat.
