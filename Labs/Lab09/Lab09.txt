Lab09 Description:	Create a superclass that all of your objects in your text
                    adventure will extend to and name it accordingly for your
                    text adventure.

                    The only attribute this class should have is private int id
                    with matching mutators and accessors that your subclasses
                    will inherit.

                    In a test class, create an ArrayList of that object type
                    and instantiate at least one object of every concrete class
                    you have in your game.

                    Add these subclasses to your ArrayList. Set some properties
                    for each class. Then loop through the ArrayList and print
                    out info on each object.

/*
  Both the created superclass and the test class can be found in the LastLaugh
  folder.
