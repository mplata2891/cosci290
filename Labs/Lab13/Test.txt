\n\nIt was a long restless night. Your dreams were full of shadows\n
and unease. As you wake up you realize, to your horror, you're\n
not in the cozy room you fell asleep last night. Instead, you find\n
yourself on a stiff bunk in a small dark room. The room is not very\n
large, and you can see from wall to wall. In the dimly lit corner\n
there is a rusty metal door.\n
