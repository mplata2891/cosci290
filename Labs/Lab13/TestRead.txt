It was a long restless night. Your dreams were full of shadows
and unease. As you wake up you realize, to your horror, you're
not in the cozy room you fell asleep last night. Instead, you find
yourself on a stiff bunk in a small dark room. The room is not very
large, and you can see from wall to wall. In the dimly lit corner
there is a rusty metal door.
