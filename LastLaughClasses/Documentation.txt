Adventure Name: 		Last Laugh

Adventure Description:	Some type of adventure that involves escaping
						rooms and clowns. And the clowns may be evil. 
						There will be a cat. Lynn really loves cats.
						I think Frank likes them too, but not as much.
						I'm a fan tho(ugh).
						
Adventure Summary:		The game starts off by asking the player's first
						name, last name, and age. The player then gets to
						choose whether to play the game as a Fighter,
						Rogue, or Magic User. The player then gets to "roll"
						20 sided dice in order to build their character's 
						stats. Once the player is done building his character,
						the actual game play starts.
						
						The player will have to move through a series of rooms
						known as "The Bewilderment". In each room the player
						will face some type of challenge. It could be an
						adversary, or maybe multiples of them. It's also possible
						the player may have to solve a puzzle. Through this ordeal,
						the player will be chasing a cat that has the potential to
						lead the player to the correct path so that the player may
						eventually escape The Bewilderment.
						
						The player will have the use of attacks during combat,
						and for solving puzzles, the player must perform some
						type of skill checks. If the player is successful in
						finding their way to the end of The Bewilderment, the
						player must defeat the final boss in order to truly 
						succeed and be freed of The Bewilderment.
